# math_map

## Background

As a math teacher, I often struggled to find the right "starting point" for any student who has significant gap in prior knowledge. I was desperate for a tool that can visualize dependency map of the math curriculum.

If you had the same struggle, here is Math Map! It is designed to provide flow chart of Common Core State Standards of Mathematics. With Math Map, you can easily identify prerequisites and dependencies of a specific math topic.


## Functionality
* Displays tree graph of math topics(K-8).
* Shows connection between each math topic to indicate dependency.
* Displays basic information on each topic with mouse hover.
* Expands/Collapses on a click.
